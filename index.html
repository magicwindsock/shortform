            Late 2018...<br><br>As <span class="highlight">TikTok</span> spread like wildfire across the phones of teens and adults alike,
            it did not take long for <span class="highlight">short-form</span> content to become a staple in the contemporary online world once again.
            Many considered <span class="highlight">TikTok</span> to be the spiritual successor to <span class="highlight">Vine</span> and <span class="highlight">Musical.ly</span>, since both had declined in
            popularity following the former's purchase by <span class="highlight">Twitter</span> in 2016, and the latter's technology and userbase
            being incoporated into <span class="highlight">TikTok</span> in the summer of 2018. Just as the app itself saw thousands of downloads by
            the hour, videos published on <span class="highlight">TikTok</span> were reposted on countless other social media platforms, instantly
            reshaping what Internet-users deemed "comedy" on an astronomical scale.

            In the five years that <span class="highlight">TikTok</span> has been dominating cyberspace, it has also sparked innovation among several
            other social media platforms, for better or for worse.  <span class="highlight">YouTube</span> and  <span class="highlight">Instagram</span> are notable examples, having
            introduced their own <span class="highlight">short-form</span> video features in 2020 and 2021. These features, known as  <span class="highlight">YouTube Shorts</span> and
            <span class="highlight">Instagram Reels</span>, allowed users to create and share quick digestible videos, and were both very similar to
            <span class="highlight">TikTok</span> in terms of functionality.<br><br>It would not be long before algorithms adhered to this style of
            content on
            either platform, and the same could be said for the users themselves. The popularity of these features
            caused accounts to grow exponentially, and the <span class="highlight">creators</span> behind them to become household names.
            These means of content production, however, would not be without its consequences, especially on
            generations renound for their fixation on <span class="highlight">technology</span>. With children all over the world spending more
            time on their parents' <span class="highlight">iPads</span> and  <span class="highlight">smartphones</span> with very little supervision, it was only a matter of time
            before the impact of accessible, fast-paced, <span class="highlight">short-form</span> content took its toll. More than ever, controversial
            figures were able to share their messages with impressionable children across the globe, spreading a slew of
            misinformation, hate speech, and other harmful ideologies.

            Teen and tweens, the primary demographic of these platforms, took refuge on a boat of <span class="highlight">short-form</span> content
            that a new wave of creators were riding. These <span class="highlight">creators</span>, who cultivated audiences based on factors such as
            their personalities, outlandish beliefs, or <span class="highlight">wealth</span>, saw exponential growth amongst the three aforementioned
            <span class="highlight">social platforms</span>. Colorful and flashy thumbnails, clickbait titles, and a myriad of other tactics conviced their
            young followings to come back for more, only bolstering support for their questionable <span class="highlight">agendas</span>. This genre of
            content, known among its dissenters as "<span class="highlight">content farming</span>" or "<span class="highlight">brainrot</span>", would receive an even stronger
            innovation in 2023, when AI generated media began infiltrating the algorithms. <span class="highlight">Misinformation</span> now laid in the palms of millions,
            who depended on fake people, fake voices, and fake news for entertainment. Some people are not aware that they have fallen into such
            dark rabbit holes. <span class="highlight">Some never come out</span>.

            I was taught by my <span class="highlight">idols</span> to enjoy horrific videos of people <span class="highlight">dying</span>, to laugh at the misfortune of others,
            and to perceive others as inferior to <span class="highlight">me</span>. I was taught that the world was a <span class="highlight">terrible place</span>,
            and that I should be afraid of it. Nobody stopped me when the world
            was eclipsed by a cloud of <span class="highlight">misinformation</span>, and nobody stopped me when I became a part of it. I was taught to be a bad person, and it's all
            your fault. My vocabulary is limited, my <span class="highlight">brain</span> can only process information in 15 second intervals. My <span class="highlight">eyes</span> have torn
            themselves apart. I am a product of innovation. I am a product of <span class="highlight">short-form</span> content.
